# Tableau Learning & Projects
## Welcome to My Tableau Learning Repository

Hello! This repository showcases my learning journey with Tableau, a powerful data visualization tool. This space captures my progress as I advance from basic Tableau concepts to more sophisticated dashboard creation, aimed at transforming data into actionable insights.

###  **Tableau Projects**

This repository features two full-fledged projects that demonstrate my ability to apply Tableau to real-world data analysis and visualization scenarios. Each project includes detailed documentation and dashboards that illustrate the analytical process from start to finish.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the files in this repository. Whether you are a fellow learner, a data professional, or just curious about Tableau for data visualization, I hope you find my projects valuable.

1. **Review the Projects**: Each project folder contains the data, Tableau workbooks, and additional documentation, along with detailed explanations of the steps taken.
2. **Explore the Dashboards**: The dashboards are designed to be interactive and user-friendly, showcasing the power of Tableau in data visualization.

## Future Plans

As I continue to grow my Tableau skills, I plan to add more advanced projects and explore deeper integration with SQL, Python and other data tools:

- **Storytelling with Data**: Using Tableau to craft compelling data stories that communicate insights effectively.
- **Data Integration**: Leveraging Tableau's ability to connect to multiple data sources for more complex analyses.
