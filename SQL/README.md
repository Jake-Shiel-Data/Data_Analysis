# SQL Learning Journey & Projects
## Welcome to My SQL Learning Repository

Hello! This repository is a showcase of my SQL learning journey. This space captures my progress as I advance from basic 
SQL concepts to more advanced database management techniques. My goal is to leverage SQL’s powerful capabilities for querying and 
manipulating data, turning raw data into actionable insights.

## What's in This Repository?

### 1. **SQL Learning Journey**

This section contains my practice files, notes, and assignments that document my progress as I’ve learned SQL. It covers fundamental topics 
essential for effective database management and data manipulation. Topics covered include:

- **What is SQL?**: Introduction to SQL and its role in data management.
- **Schemas**: Understanding database structures and organization.
- **Relationships**: How tables relate to each other in a database.
- **Data Types**: Various types of data used in SQL databases.
- **Basic Statements**: Basic querying techniques to retrieve data.
- **LIKE**: Using pattern matching to search for data.
- **JOINS**: Combining rows from multiple tables based on related columns.
- **UNION**: Merging results from multiple queries.

### 2. **SQL Assignment**

This repository features an assignment completed during my JustIT Data Technician Bootcamp. The assignment involves practical SQL tasks to 
demonstrate my ability to apply SQL concepts to real-world data scenarios.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the files in this repository. Whether you are a fellow learner, a data professional, or just curious about Python for data analysis, I hope you find my journey and projects valuable.

1. **Browse the Learning Journey**: Start with the learning journey notes to understand the foundational concepts before diving into the projects.
2. **Review the Projects**: Each project folder contains the data, Python scripts, and visualizations, along with detailed explanations of the steps taken.
3. **Explore the Code**: The code is well-commented to help you follow along with the analysis process.

## Future Plans

As I continue to grow my Python skills, I plan to add more advanced projects and delve deeper into areas such as:

- **Automation**: Using Python to automate data processing tasks, such as web scraping and report generation.
- **Data Engineering**: Exploring the use of Python in data pipeline creation, ETL processes, and database management.
