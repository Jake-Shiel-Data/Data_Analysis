# Python Learning Journey & Projects
## Welcome to My Python Learning Repository

Hello! This repository is a showcase of my Python learning journey. This space captures my progress as I advance from basic Python concepts to more sophisticated data analysis techniques using libraries like Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. My goal is to leverage Python’s powerful capabilities for data manipulation and visualization, turning raw data into actionable insights.

## What's in This Repository?
### 1. **Python Learning Journey**

This section contains my practice files, notes, and mini-projects that document my progress as I’ve learned Python. It covers everything from the fundamentals to more advanced data analysis topics. Some key areas include:

- **Basic Python Concepts**: Introduction to Python syntax, data types, control structures, functions, and object-oriented programming.
  
- **Data Manipulation with Pandas**: Working with DataFrames, handling missing data, data aggregation, and merging datasets.

- **Numerical Computation with NumPy**: Exploring NumPy arrays, performing mathematical operations, and utilizing broadcasting.

- **Data Visualization with Matplotlib and Seaborn**: Creating a variety of plots and charts to visualize data trends, distributions, and relationships.

### 2. **Python Projects**

This repository features two full-fledged projects that demonstrate my ability to apply Python to real-world data analysis scenarios. Each project includes detailed documentation and code to illustrate the analytical process from start to finish.

#### **Project 1: Fitness Tracking Data Analysis**
- **Description**: In this project, I analyze a dataset from a fitness tracker to explore patterns in physical activity. The analysis includes cleaning/transforming the data and visualizing trends over time.
- **Tools Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.


#### **Project 2: Hotel Bookings Data Analysis**
- **Description**: This project involves analyzing hotel booking data to gain insights into customer behavior, booking patterns, and revenue trends. The goal is to identify factors that influence cancellations, booking lead times, and average daily rates.
- This notebook will only work in its current state when run in google colab due to the mounting of the drive. Make sure to
download the CSV if you want to use another notebook editor.
- **Tools Used**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn.

## How to Use This Repository

Feel free to explore the files in this repository. Whether you are a fellow learner, a data professional, or just curious about Python for data analysis, I hope you find my journey and projects valuable.

1. **Browse the Learning Journey**: Start with the learning journey notes to understand the foundational concepts before diving into the projects.
2. **Review the Projects**: Each project folder contains the data, Python scripts, and visualizations, along with detailed explanations of the steps taken.
3. **Explore the Code**: The code is well-commented to help you follow along with the analysis process.

## Future Plans

As I continue to grow my Python skills, I plan to add more advanced projects and delve deeper into areas such as:

- **Automation**: Using Python to automate data processing tasks, such as web scraping and report generation.
- **Data Engineering**: Exploring the use of Python in data pipeline creation, ETL processes, and database management.
